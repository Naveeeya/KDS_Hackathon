# Track-A Compliant Backstory Consistency Checker

This project implements a system to determine if a hypothetical backstory is consistent with a full novel by modeling characters as evolving constraint systems.

## Architecture

- **pathway_pipeline**: Handles data ingestion and orchestration using Pathway.
- **narrative**: Processes the novel into chunks and detects meaningful experiences.
- **constraints**: Defines schemas and logic for constraints, updates, and comparisons.
- **backstory**: Parses backstories into constraints.
- **evidence**: Retrieves evidence snippets.
- **tests**: Unit tests.

## Usage

1. Install requirements: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. Run the pipeline: `python pathway_pipeline/orchestration.py`
3. Check results in `results/results.csv`

## Requirements

- Python 3.10+
- Pathway framework
